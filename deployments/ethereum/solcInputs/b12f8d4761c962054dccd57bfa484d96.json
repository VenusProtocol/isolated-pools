Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n *\n * For example:\n *\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n * ```solidity\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\n *         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n *     }\n * }\n *\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n *     }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n *\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n *\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker.

This contract extends\n * the ERC20 standard. Any additional extensions included along it would affect the \"shares\" token represented by this\n * contract and not the \"assets\" token which is an independent contract.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * In empty (or nearly empty) ERC-4626 vaults, deposits are at high risk of being stolen through frontrunning\n * with a \"donation\" to the vault that inflates the price of a share. This is variously known as a donation or inflation\n * attack and is essentially a problem of slippage. Vault deployers can protect against this attack by making an initial\n * deposit of a non-trivial amount of the asset, such that price manipulation becomes infeasible. Withdrawals may\n * similarly be affected by slippage. Users can protect against this attack as well as unexpected slippage in general by\n * verifying the amount received is as expected, using a wrapper that performs these checks such as\n * https://github.com/fei-protocol/ERC4626#erc4626router-and-base[ERC4626Router].\n *\n * Since v4.9, this implementation uses virtual assets and shares to mitigate that risk. The `_decimalsOffset()`\n * corresponds to an offset in the decimal representation between the underlying asset's decimals and the vault\n * decimals. This offset also determines the rate of virtual shares to virtual assets in the vault, which itself\n * determines the initial exchange rate. While not fully preventing the attack, analysis shows that the default offset\n * (0) makes it non-profitable, as a result of the value being captured by the virtual shares (out of the attacker's\n * donation) matching the attacker's expected gains.

The second is that because permits have\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun.

(See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n    /**\n     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n     *\n     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n     * ordering also apply here.\n     *\n     * Emits an {Approval} event.\n     *\n     * Requirements:\n     *\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n     *\n     * For more information on the signature format, see the\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n     * section].\n     *\n     * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n     */\n    function permit(\n        address owner,\n        address spender,\n        uint256 value,\n        uint256 deadline,\n        uint8 v,\n        bytes32 r,\n        bytes32 s\n    ) external;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

      "content": "// SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause\npragma solidity 0.8.25;\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol\";\nimport \"./IAccessControlManagerV8.sol\";\n\n/**\n * @title AccessControlManager\n * @author Venus\n * @dev This contract is a wrapper of OpenZeppelin AccessControl extending it in a way to standartize access control within Venus Smart Contract Ecosystem.\n * @notice Access control plays a crucial role in the Venus governance model. It is used to restrict functions so that they can only be called from one\n * account or list of accounts (EOA or Contract Accounts).\n *\n * The implementation of `AccessControlManager`(https://github.com/VenusProtocol/governance-contracts/blob/main/contracts/Governance/AccessControlManager.sol)\n * inherits the [Open Zeppelin AccessControl](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol)\n * contract as a base for role management logic. There are two role types: admin and granular permissions.\n * \n * ## Granular Roles\n * \n * Granular roles are built by hashing the contract address and its function signature. For example, given contract `Foo` with function `Foo.bar()` which\n * is guarded by ACM, calling `giveRolePermission` for account B do the following:\n * \n * 1. Compute `keccak256(contractFooAddress,functionSignatureBar)`\n * 1. Add the computed role to the roles of account B\n * 1. Account B now can call `ContractFoo.bar()`\n * \n * ## Admin Roles\n * \n * Admin roles allow for an address to call a function signature on any contract guarded by the `AccessControlManager`. This is particularly useful for\n * contracts created by factories.\n * \n * For Admin roles a null address is hashed in place of the contract address (`keccak256(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000,functionSignatureBar)`.\n * \n * In the previous example, giving account B the admin role, account B will have permissions to call the `bar()` function on any contract that is guarded by\n * ACM, not only contract A.\n * \n * ## Protocol Integration\n * \n * All restricted functions in Venus Protocol use a hook to ACM in order to check if the caller has the right permission to call the guarded function.\n * `AccessControlledV5` and `AccessControlledV8` abstract contract makes this integration easier. They call ACM's external method\n * `isAllowedToCall(address caller, string functionSig)`. Here is an example of how `setCollateralFactor` function in `Comptroller` is integrated with ACM:\n\n```\n    contract Comptroller is [...] AccessControlledV8 {\n        [...]\n        function setCollateralFactor(VToken vToken, uint256 newCollateralFactorMantissa, uint256 newLiquidationThresholdMantissa) external {\n            _checkAccessAllowed(\"setCollateralFactor(address,uint256,uint256)\");\n            [...]\n        }\n    }\n```\n */\ncontract AccessControlManager is AccessControl, IAccessControlManagerV8 {\n    /// @notice Emitted when an account is given a permission to a certain contract function\n    /// @dev If contract address is 0x000..0 this means that the account is a default admin of this function and\n    /// can call any contract function with this signature\n    event PermissionGranted(address account, address contractAddress, string functionSig);\n\n    /// @notice Emitted when an account is revoked a permission to a certain contract function\n    event PermissionRevoked(address account, address contractAddress, string functionSig);\n\n    constructor() {\n        // Grant the contract deployer the default admin role: it will be able\n        // to grant and revoke any roles\n        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Gives a function call permission to one single account\n     * @dev this function can be called only from Role Admin or DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE\n     * @param contractAddress address of contract for which call permissions will be granted\n     * @dev if contractAddress is zero address, the account can access the specified function\n     *      on **any** contract managed by this ACL\n     * @param functionSig signature e.g. \"functionName(uint256,bool)\"\n     * @param accountToPermit account that will be given access to the contract function\n     * @custom:event Emits a {RoleGranted} and {PermissionGranted} events.\n     */\n    function giveCallPermission(address contractAddress, string calldata functionSig, address accountToPermit) public {\n        bytes32 role = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(contractAddress, functionSig));\n        grantRole(role, accountToPermit);\n        emit PermissionGranted(accountToPermit, contractAddress, functionSig);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Revokes an account's permission to a particular function call\n     * @dev this function can be called only from Role Admin or DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE\n     * \t\tMay emit a {RoleRevoked} event.\n     * @param contractAddress address of contract for which call permissions will be revoked\n     * @param functionSig signature e.g. \"functionName(uint256,bool)\"\n     * @custom:event Emits {RoleRevoked} and {PermissionRevoked} events.\n     */\n    function revokeCallPermission(\n        address contractAddress,\n        string calldata functionSig,\n        address accountToRevoke\n    ) public {\n        bytes32 role = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(contractAddress, functionSig));\n        revokeRole(role, accountToRevoke);\n        emit PermissionRevoked(accountToRevoke, contractAddress, functionSig);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Verifies if the given account can call a contract's guarded function\n     * @dev Since restricted contracts using this function as a permission hook, we can get contracts address with msg.sender\n     * @param account for which call permissions will be checked\n     * @param functionSig restricted function signature e.g. \"functionName(uint256,bool)\"\n     * @return false if the user account cannot call the particular contract function\n     *\n     */\n    function isAllowedToCall(address account, string calldata functionSig) public view returns (bool) {\n        bytes32 role = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, functionSig));\n\n        if (hasRole(role, account)) {\n            return true;\n        } else {\n            role = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(address(0), functionSig));\n            return hasRole(role, account);\n        }\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Verifies if the given account can call a contract's guarded function\n     * @dev This function is used as a view function to check permissions rather than contract hook for access restriction check.\n     * @param account for which call permissions will be checked against\n     * @param contractAddress address of the restricted contract\n     * @param functionSig signature of the restricted function e.g. \"functionName(uint256,bool)\"\n     * @return false if the user account cannot call the particular contract function\n     */\n    function hasPermission(\n        address account,\n        address contractAddress,\n        string calldata functionSig\n    ) public view returns (bool) {\n        bytes32 role = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(contractAddress, functionSig));\n        return hasRole(role, account);\n    }\n}\n"

Each pool has one `Comptroller` checking these interactions across markets. When a user interacts\n * with a given market by one of these main actions, a call is made to a corresponding hook in the associated `Comptroller`, which either allows\n * or reverts the transaction. These hooks also update supply and borrow rewards as they are called. The comptroller holds the logic for assessing\n * liquidity snapshots of an account via the collateral factor and liquidation threshold. This check determines the collateral needed for a borrow,\n * as well as how much of a borrow may be liquidated. A user may borrow a portion of their collateral with the maximum amount determined by the\n * markets collateral factor. However, if their borrowed amount exceeds an amount calculated using the market’s corresponding liquidation threshold,\n * the borrow is eligible for liquidation.\n *\n * The `Comptroller` also includes two functions `liquidateAccount()` and `healAccount()`, which are meant to handle accounts that do not exceed\n * the `minLiquidatableCollateral` for the `Comptroller`:\n *\n * - `healAccount()`: This function is called to seize all of a given user’s collateral, requiring the `msg.sender` repay a certain percentage\n * of the debt calculated by `collateral/(borrows*liquidationIncentive)`. The function can only be called if the calculated percentage does not exceed\n * 100%, because otherwise no `badDebt` would be created and `liquidateAccount()` should be used instead. The difference in the actual amount of debt\n * and debt paid off is recorded as `badDebt` for each market, which can then be auctioned off for the risk reserves of the associated pool.\n * - `liquidateAccount()`: This function can only be called if the collateral seized will cover all borrows of an account, as well as the liquidation\n * incentive. Otherwise, the pool will incur bad debt, in which case the function `healAccount()` should be used instead. This function skips the logic\n * verifying that the repay amount does not exceed the close factor.\n */\ncontract Comptroller is\n    Ownable2StepUpgradeable,\n    AccessControlledV8,\n

The `PoolRegistry` maintains a directory of isolated lending\n * pools and can perform actions like creating and registering new pools, adding new markets to existing pools, setting and updating the pool's required\n * metadata, and providing the getter methods to get information on the pools.\n *\n * Isolated lending has three main components: PoolRegistry, pools, and markets. The PoolRegistry is responsible for managing pools.\n * It can create new pools, update pool metadata and manage markets within pools. PoolRegistry contains getter methods to get the details of\n * any existing pool like `getVTokenForAsset` and `getPoolsSupportedByAsset`. It also contains methods for updating pool metadata (`updatePoolMetadata`)\n * and setting pool name (`setPoolName`).\n *\n * The directory of pools is managed through two mappings: `_poolByComptroller` which is a hashmap with the comptroller address as the key and `VenusPool` as\n * the value and `_poolsByID` which is an array of comptroller addresses. Individual pools can be accessed by calling `getPoolByComptroller` with the pool's\n * comptroller address. `_poolsByID` is used to iterate through all of the pools.\n *\n * PoolRegistry also contains a map of asset addresses called `_supportedPools` that maps to an array of assets suppored by each pool. This array of pools by\n * asset is retrieved by calling `getPoolsSupportedByAsset`.\n *\n * PoolRegistry registers new isolated pools in the directory with the `createRegistryPool` method. Isolated pools are composed of independent markets with\n * specific assets and custom risk management configurations according to their markets.\n */\ncontract PoolRegistry is Ownable2StepUpgradeable, AccessControlledV8, PoolRegistryInterface {\n    using SafeERC20Upgradeable for IERC20Upgradeable;\n\n    struct AddMarketInput {\n        VToken vToken;\n        uint256 collateralFactor;\n        uint256 liquidationThreshold;\n        uint256 initialSupply;\n        address vTokenReceiver;\n        uint256 supplyCap;\n        uint256 borrowCap;\n    }\n\n    uint256 internal constant MAX_POOL_NAME_LENGTH = 100;\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Maps pool's comptroller address to metadata.\n     */\n    mapping(address => VenusPoolMetaData) public metadata;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Maps pool ID to pool's comptroller address\n     */\n    mapping(uint256 => address) private _poolsByID;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Total number of pools created.\n     */\n    uint256 private _numberOfPools;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Maps comptroller address to Venus pool Index.\n     */\n    mapping(address => VenusPool) private _poolByComptroller;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Maps pool's comptroller address to asset to vToken.\n     */\n    mapping(address => mapping(address => address)) private _vTokens;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Maps asset to list of supported pools.\n     */\n    mapping(address => address[]) private _supportedPools;\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Emitted when a new Venus pool is added to the directory.\n     */\n    event PoolRegistered(address indexed comptroller, VenusPool pool);\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Emitted when a pool name is set.\n     */\n    event PoolNameSet(address indexed comptroller, string oldName, string newName);\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Emitted when a pool metadata is updated.\n     */\n    event PoolMetadataUpdated(\n        address indexed comptroller,\n        VenusPoolMetaData oldMetadata,\n        VenusPoolMetaData newMetadata\n    );\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Emitted when a Market is added to the pool.\n     */\n    event MarketAdded(address indexed comptroller, address indexed vTokenAddress);\n\n    /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n    constructor() {\n        // Note that the contract is upgradeable.

As outlined in the protocol overview,\n * each isolated pool creates its own `vToken` corresponding to an asset. Within a given pool, each included `vToken` is referred to as a market of\n * the pool. The main actions a user regularly interacts with in a market are:\n\n- mint/redeem of vTokens;\n- transfer of vTokens;\n- borrow/repay a loan on an underlying asset;\n- liquidate a borrow or liquidate/heal an account.\n\n * A user supplies the underlying asset to a pool by minting `vTokens`, where the corresponding `vToken` amount is determined by the `exchangeRate`.\n * The `exchangeRate` will change over time, dependent on a number of factors, some of which accrue interest. Additionally, once users have minted\n * `vToken` in a pool, they can borrow any asset in the isolated pool by using their `vToken` as collateral. In order to borrow an asset or use a `vToken`\n * as collateral, the user must be entered into each corresponding market (else, the `vToken` will not be considered collateral for a borrow). Note that\n * a user may borrow up to a portion of their collateral determined by the market’s collateral factor. However, if their borrowed amount exceeds an amount\n * calculated using the market’s corresponding liquidation threshold, the borrow is eligible for liquidation. When a user repays a borrow, they must also\n * pay off interest accrued on the borrow.\n * \n * The Venus protocol includes unique mechanisms for healing an account and liquidating an account. These actions are performed in the `Comptroller`\n * and consider all borrows and collateral for which a given account is entered within a market. These functions may only be called on an account with a\n * total collateral amount that is no larger than a universal `minLiquidatableCollateral` value, which is used for all markets within a `Comptroller`.\n * Both functions settle all of an account’s borrows, but `healAccount()` may add `badDebt` to a vToken.
